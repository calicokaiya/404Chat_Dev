		<h3>What is 404Chat?</h3>
		<p>404Chat is a web application private chat, where every single one of your messages is deleted
			a couple of seconds after being sent, and everything is deleted from the database twice a day.<br>
			The point is to offer a safe, private and temporary environment to communicate important and possibly
			classified information to others.</p>

	<div class="about_whomadeit">
		<h3>Who made 404Chat?</h3>
		<p>404Chat was made by a programming student and enthusiast with a love for cybersecurity, and communication
			technologies, that would like to keep their identity private. My contacts will remain hidden for now,
			but I do plan on coming out and showing myself to some extent some day. I'm just not ready for it yet.</p>

			<h3>How do I use 404Chat?</h3>
			<p>This application works through the use of mainly chat commands. These commands are:
				<ul>
					<li>"/create [roomname] [password]". This will create a room with name [roomname] and password [password].<br>
						Password is optional.<br>
						If you try to create a room that already exists, it will attempt to join said room with provided roomname and password.
					</li>
					<li>"/join [roomname] [password]". This will join a room if the roomname and password combinations are valid.</br></li>
					<li>"/help" displays this information in the chatroom so you don't have to visit the about page constantly.</li>

			<h3>Is my information really 100% safe?</h3>
			<p>Nothing is ever 100% safe. Every single thing that exists in this planet can be exploited in some way or another.<br>
			With that being said, as long as there isn't anything on your end like a virus, then this application should be safe.</br>
			<b>I am not responsible for any information leaks. As you use this website, you understand and accept that
			there is absolutely no way for me to guarantee your privacy at 1000%, and things can happen.<br>
			You are responsible for your own information.</b>

			<h3>What other projects do you have / what do you plan on doing with 404Chat?</h3>
			<p>I have a whole range of projects made for personal use that I do not want to mention to maintain my identity hidden.<br>
			I made this project with the intent of learning more about programming and cybersecurity, more so than
				creating a project that other people can use. With that being said, I'm not sure if I will end up uploading it
				to any public servers any time soon.<br>
			As for features, I will keep fixing any bugs that might show up, and adding any quality of life features, simply to
				prove that I can, and because I like working on this project. It's my little baby.</p>

			<h3>But I found a bug / security flaw!</h3>
			<p>I commend you for that. Don't shed light into it, and don't abuse it, and I'll be more than thankful to you.</p>
