# What is this?

404Chat is a chatting API and front end built entirely from scratch using nothing but standard PHP, JS with JQuery, HTML and CSS. It was a project made as a graduation project in order to prove my skills.

It has, by design, no registration process. No logs are stored.

Truth be told, it is only here so people can look through the code. I recommend not even bothering with this.

# Dependencies

This requires PHP (not sure which version), and a MySQL database at least. I do not believe I have the database backup file saved.

It was also made assuming that the user is usimg XAMPP on Windows. Dark days those were - I don't even develop for Windows anymore.

# Has this been abandoned / does it still work?

It has very much been abandoned. Truth be told, I only decided to set this repo as public recently because I wanted something to prove my coding skills on my page.

I have not touched this in an extremely long time, and I do not know if it actually works.

If you would like to make a fork of it, by all means, go ahead, but **I would not recommend that you spend your time trying to make this work.**

# API

You will find the API in the /php folder.

All client-side code are in the other folders.

# Database

404chat.sql is the database script that will create all your database and tables and such.

## Feel free to fork this for your own amusement if you wish.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
