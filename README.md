# What is this?

404Chat is a chatting API and front end built entirely from scratch using nothing but standard PHP, JS with JQuery, HTML and CSS. It was a project made as a graduation project in order to prove my skills.

It has, by design, no registration process. No logs are stored.

# Dependencies

This requires PHP (not sure which version), and a MySQL database at least.

# Has this been abandoned / does it still work?

It has very much been abandoned. Truth be told, I only decided to set this repo as public recently because I wanted something to prove my coding skills on my page.

I have not touched this in an extremely long time, and I do not know if it actually works.

If you would like to make a fork of it, by all means, go ahead.


# API

You will find the API in the /php folder.

All client-side code are in the other folders.


## Feel free to fork this for your own amusement if you wish.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
